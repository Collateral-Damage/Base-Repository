# What is Community-Dev?
Community dev (Temp name) is a team founded by DrasticDemise for the group collaboration of modpack development. This group is open to **all** members of the community who show an expressed interest in pack development, testing, and production. 

#Why is this different? 
Unlike other pack development teams, admission to this team is not fixed through invite or notable works. Admission is always open and all-inclusive to those that want to be here! All pack development repositories are open to the public and free for download AND contribution at any point in their development, license withstanding.

#How does development work?
Once an idea has been refined and approved, Project Leaders will assemble a team for the development of that specific pack. Pack-specific teams are formed on a volunteer basis from the members listed here. From there, development goes into full swing! Mod lists are created, config changes are made, scripts are scripted and test versions are compiled! The pack is molded around the original idea that was layed out while receiving the supervision of the project leader. Full documentation of **all** stages of development will be available in that packs repository or forum section.

1. Idea Stage
2. Initial Design - Pack Goals, Difficulty, Theme, What makes it unique!
3. Small team formation
4. Proposed Mod List
5. Config Changes
6. Testing!
7. Repeat!
 
Ideas, themes, and major changes are held to a team-wide vote. Everybody counts!

#Who is needed?
Development of a pack pulls from the entire spectrum of the modded community! Members are organized by their unique functions as the following: 

1. Lore/Quest writers
2. Script Junkies
3. Crash Testers
4. Artists
5. Media Producers
6. General Pack Shenaniganizers

Anybody with an ounce of creativity is encouraged to join the team - your input is always valuable!

#Who can join?
You can! Pack development encompasses an entire spectrum of people in the Minecraft Modded Community, and you are apart of it!

There are no restrictions put in place as to who can be a member so long as the following guidelines are met:

1. You are able to communicate your ideas coherently.
2. You can work well with others and in a team environment!
3. You are ready to have a blast!

The only other expectation is that those volunteering for pack-teams will be able to set aside time for development. That is about it!
