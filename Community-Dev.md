# What is Community-Dev?
Community dev (Temp name) is a group founded by DrasticDemise for the group collaboration of modpack development. This group is open to **all** members of the community who show an expressed interest in pack development, testing, and production. 

#Why is it different and how does it work? 
Unlike other pack development teams, admission to this team is not fixed through invite or notable works. Admission is always open and all-inclusive to those that want to be here!
