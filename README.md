# Base-Repository
Model repository for all future repos.
Each repo should have a folder for Client and Server files. 

1. Folders should contain ONLY what is necessary to the end user. Mods, Configs, Scripts, Template, ETC.
2. Server files should contain all forge libraries and jars necessary to run the server.
3. Server files do **NOT** include server properties, EULA, whitelist, ETC. These are generated when the server jar is run. 

This section of the README above can be replaced with the Repository name and pack information once established. These guidelines still apply.

#Documentation
All commits, pull requests or issues need to follow these guidelines upon submit:



# Script Structure
All script file(s) created should meet the following conditions:

1. Recipes are grouped by type. Types should be logically named and seperated. Ex: "Armor Recipe Changes" is okay, "Group 1" is not okay.
2. All groups are properly commented. It should be evident what the purpose of the script was.
3. The file is easily readable to anybody. There should be proper white space, indentation and seperation of group blocks.
